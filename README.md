Pikelet is a small, functional, dependently typed programming language.

Dependent types allow us to do a bunch of really interesting things, like using
records for modules, declaring the length of arrays at the type level, and
much more â€” many of great utility for low-level and high-level code alike!

We hope to one day grow Pikelet into fully-fledged systems programming language,
with support for unboxed data types, control over memory layout and allocation
strategy, linear types, and a flexible phase distinction and support for calling
other languages. At the moment however we've only implemented a type checker and
very slow  interpreter, so don't get your hopes up too much yet! There's still a
whole lot to do before it is even remotely useful to anyone! ðŸ˜…

## Contributing

We really want to encourage new contributors to help out! Please come chat with
us [on our Gitter channel][gitter-lobby] - if you have any questions about the
project, or just want to say hi! We sometimes get side-tracked on technical
discussions, but we're always more than happy to spend time explaining things.
