Looking into the future it would also be nice to then move forward towards implementing a native compiler, however. At the moment we are building the language in Rust, but perhaps it would be better to build a verified implementation in Coq/Agda/Lean/Idris/something else. That way we can actually start proving some of the claims we desire to make about our system. A concern could be that we go too far down the route of implementation and it would be extremely challenging to then form a solid specification for what we are building.

This is quite similar to the problem we face with iterators: // 'internal' iteration\nvec![1, 2, 3].map(|x| x * x).filter(|x| x < 3) // 'external' iteration\nvec![1, 2, 3].iter().map(|x| x * x).filter(|x| x < 3).collect() The first example, which uses 'internal' iteration allocates a new collection after each operation, resulting in three allocated collections. We can improve the performance however by using 'external' iteration - ie. returning a series of chained iterator adaptors, that only perform the allocation on the call to collect . This emulates the 'fusion' that languages like Haskell perform to reduce intermediate allocations. We could potentially get some fusion between the stages of our compiler by way of the visitor pattern .","breadcrumbs":"Appendix » Performance considerations","id":"appendix/implementation.html#performance-considerations","title":"Performance considerations"},"appendix/implementation.html#resources":{"body":"Queries: demand-driven compilation (Rustc Book) Anders Hejlsberg on Modern Compiler Construction (YouTube)","breadcrumbs":"Appendix » Resources","id":"appendix/implementation.html#resources","title":"Resources"},"appendix/implementation.html#support-for-interactive-development":{"body":"It would be interesting to see how Pikelet could be implemented using an asynchronous, query-based architecture.

This makes the flow of information through the type checker clear and relatively easy to reason about. Normalization happens after inference, and before types are fed back in to be used during type checking. With that in mind, the next sections will describe the following judgments: name notation inputs outputs normalization \\(\\eval{ \\Gamma }{ \\texpr }{ \\vexpr }\\) \\(\\Gamma\\), \\(\\rexpr\\) \\(\\vexpr\\) type checking \\(\\check{ \\Gamma }{ \\rexpr }{ \\vtype }{ \\texpr }\\) \\(\\Gamma\\), \\(\\rexpr\\), \\(\\vtype\\) \\(\\texpr\\) type inference \\(\\infer{ \\Gamma }{ \\rexpr }{ \\vtype }{ \\texpr }\\) \\(\\Gamma\\), \\(\\rexpr\\) \\(\\vtype\\), \\(\\texpr\\) Normalization stands on its own, but both checking and inference are mutually dependent on each other. Care has been taken to design the judgments so that they are syntax-directed , meaning that an algorithm can be clearly derived from them.
